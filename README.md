 Job Market Dashboard Project

## üéØ Objectives

This project aims to analyze job market demand using scraped data from LinkedIn job posts, with a specific focus on data-related roles. The goal is to provide an interactive dashboard that helps job seekers explore opportunities by:

- **Job Title**
- **Country**
- **Experience Level**
- **Skills in Demand**

By understanding the current job trends, users can identify which roles and skills are most valuable in the market.

## üß™ Dataset

- **Source**: Scraped from LinkedIn over one week
- **Focus**: Data-related jobs (e.g., Data Analyst, Data Scientist, Data Engineer, etc.)
- **Challenges**:
  - Unstructured and noisy text data
  - Inconsistent formatting
  - Missing or vague fields

## ‚öôÔ∏è Data Cleaning & Preparation
![applied steps in final tablepng](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/15ae341b-d9dc-4076-8990-241eaad87c57)

### üßπ Title & Location Cleaning (Power Query M)
Standardized `title` and `location` fields using Power Query:

```m
Text.Replace(Text.Replace(Text.Lower(Text.Trim([title])), ".", ""), ",", "")
Text.Replace(Text.Replace(Text.Lower(Text.Trim([location])), ".", ""), ",", ",")
```


### üß† Title & Country Normalization
Used ChatGPT to map messy job titles and country names into standardized, generic labels (e.g., "Data Analyst", "USA").

## üß† Skill Extraction from Description

Used custom M logic to assign relevant skills based on job title and then matched them in the job description:

```m
let
    title = Text.Lower([Title]),
    desc = if [description] = null then "" else [description],

    skillsList =
        if Text.Contains(title, "data analyst") then
            {"SQL", "Excel", "Tableau", "Power BI", "Python", "Statistics"}
        else if Text.Contains(title, "data scientist") then
            {"Python", "R", "SQL", "Machine Learning", "NLP", "Statistics"}
        else if Text.Contains(title, "data engineer") then
            {"SQL", "Python", "ETL", "Spark", "AWS", "BigQuery"}
        else if Text.Contains(title, "frontend") then
            {"HTML", "CSS", "JavaScript", "React", "Angular"}
        else if Text.Contains(title, "machine learning") then
            {"Python", "TensorFlow", "PyTorch", "ML", "NLP"}
        else if Text.Contains(title, "software engineer") then
            {"Python", "Java", "C++", "Git", "Algorithms", "SQL"}
        else
            {},

    matchedSkills =
        List.Select(
            skillsList,
            each Text.Contains(desc, _, Comparer.OrdinalIgnoreCase)
        )
in
    Text.Combine(matchedSkills, ", ")
```

- **Post-Processing**:
  - Split skills by delimiter
  - Unpivoted skill columns for better aggregation

## üß≠ Experience Level Classification

Extracted seniority from the title using this logic:

```m
let
    titleLower = Text.Lower([Title])
in
    if Text.Contains(titleLower, "senior") then
        "Senior"
    else if Text.Contains(titleLower, "intern") then
        "Intern"
    else
        "Junior"
```
